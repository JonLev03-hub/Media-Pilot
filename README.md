# Media Pilot Website 
Media Pilot is a tool designed for business owners and influencers that helps improve interactivity by allowing you to make scheduled posts, view analytics about your account, and get suggestions based on other users. I designed this website to display my ability to create and build a product landing page from scratch.

### Homepage 
#### web version :

The entire site is mobily responsive and stacks when the screen is too small. Along with that the navbar turns into a button with a drop down. 






## My Responsibilities :
I am designing and building this project is being designed and built by myself. I will be responsible for all front end design, and implimentation. Additionally, I will be responsible for developing the back end API's and inner functionality of the website, hosting, and project management.

## Problems :
One of the main problems when building this site has been the design and layout. Most of the websites I have built so far have been relatively streight forward but when I started this project I hadn't had much experience creating the content for sites. I soon noticed building a design that is simple or already made is the easy part. The hard part is finding what parts can go together and look amazing in the process

## The future for this project
Once I have become better at website design patterns and themes I would love to revisit this product to impliment a more visually pleasing design. Along with that once I get more practice with user authentication, security, and AWS I would love to design the back end for this service and put it into production.
